## Requirements-
The system is totally decentralized where professors own their talent and experience not the educational institution. 

The professor manages their own courses as well as what they want to teach and when to teach them. Students sign up as they please.
The professor has full autonomy. Likely the professor will be offering courses in their specialty. A reputation index will be available to help aspiring students decide which courses fit best.
A professor will join the service and operate remotely from anywhere in the world.
Professor services are visible and accessible from anywhere in the world, using tablets, browsers, smart devices, etc.
To earn their degree, students must fulfill course requirements which means courses must be taken from many professors (residing anywhere in the world)
The underlying digital platform offers third party certification authority to approve the degree. You might want to consider different certification authorities. One third party might have better access to employers for example.
Course prices are set by the professor and can vary and easy to adjust depending on demand
Tuition for courses go directly to the professor. The professor will pay subscription fees for use of the digital platform.

## Objective-
The objective of this assignment is to instill in you the techniques for turning an object model into a machine for information gathering and data aggregation. 
We want to use software engineering techniques to reduce tuition cost while improving the quality of education anywhere in the world. We want to hold people accountable for improving the quality of life for the masses through education, learning to learn, and feedback.
